# KrishiAI 🌾
> The Temporal Arbitrage Engine: Empowering 146M Smallholders to Optimize the 72-Hour Harvest-to-Market Window.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Indian farmers lose ₹92,000 Crore annually due to post-harvest mistiming. This isn't a "farming" problem; it's a coordination failure. When thousands of farmers harvest simultaneously without data, they create artificial supply gluts, crashing prices by up to 80% and forcing distress sales.

**KrishiAI** transforms the farmer from a "Price Taker" into a "Market Strategist" using fused intelligence.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The Decision Dashboard (Harvest Window Optimizer)
- **Status**: Red/Yellow/Green "Stoplight" indicators for optimal harvest timing.
- **Logic**: Fuses IMD weather forecasts with Agmarknet price trends and crop maturity models.
- **Outcome**: Suggests the specific 24-hour window that maximizes "Net Realization."

### 2. Explainable AI (The "Agri-Vakeel")
- **Multilingual Chatbot**: A voice-enabled assistant that "narrates" the dashboard.
- **The "Why" Layer**: Instead of a black-box advice, it explains: *"Prices in Pune are rising due to supply shortages in neighboring districts—wait 2 days."*

### 3. Shock-Alert Transit Guardian
- **Hardware-Free Monitoring**: Uses the mobile phone’s accelerometer to detect potholes and sudden braking during transit.
- **Damage Prediction**: Alerts the farmer if transit "shocks" likely degraded the crop grade, suggesting a shift from premium to processor markets to save value.

### 4. Zero-Internet Resilience
- **PWA Architecture**: Works on low-end devices with offline caching.
- **Background Sync**: Queues harvest logs and syncs them automatically when the farmer hits a 2G/4G patch.

### 5. Transport & Batching Intelligence
- **Load Matching**: Suggests co-loading with neighbors to split transport costs.
- **Net-Profit Ranking**: Ranks Mandis by *Price - (Fuel + Spoilage Risk)*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*(To be added)*

## 🏗️ Architecture & Logic Flow
- **Ingestion**: Backend fetches hourly Mandi prices and gridded weather data.
- **Analysis**: The Net Realization Algorithm calculates potential profit vs. decay penalty.
- **Distribution**: Insights are pushed to a mobile-first PWA designed for low-literacy users (icons > text).
- **Interaction**: A Voice-to-Text AI clarifies trade-offs (e.g., "Storage Cost vs. Price Gain").

## 🧪 Installation & Setup

## 🛡️ Data Privacy (DPDP Act 2023 Compliance)
- **Consent-Driven**: Granular permission for GPS and sensor data.
- **Minimalism**: No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) collected beyond Phone Number.
- **Transparency**: Clear logs of how advice is generated from public data sources.

## 🌟 What Makes This Unique?
- **Timing over Yield**: Most agritech apps focus on Yield or Marketplaces. **KrishiAI** focuses on **Timing**. By desynchronizing harvest windows across clusters of farmers, we stabilize local market supply and reclaim the 25% value lost to "panic harvesting."
- **⚡ Dynamic Shock Absorption**: Unlike static apps, KrishiAI monitors for 'Black Swan' events. Using Z-score volatility analysis, it detects sudden market gluts or weather shifts in real-time, providing 'Pivot Advice' to farmers already in transit, potentially saving 100% of the load value from distress sales.
